## Research Writing Samples

This repository contains selected research manuscripts prepared during my master's studies and industrial internship experience.<br>  
These papers are shared **solely for academic review purposes** (e.g., PhD applications) to demonstrate research methodology and writing style.<br>  
All manuscripts are **drafts or unpublished works** and should **not be cited or redistributed** without permission from the respective co-authors or organizations involved.  


**Authorship and Acknowledgment**  
Each manuscript in this repository includes proper authorship and attribution.  
Please note that these drafts may have been developed under academic supervision or industrial collaboration (e.g., Queenâ€™s University, iQIYI Inc.),  
and are not official publications.


**Anonymous Research Manuscripts**  
Some manuscripts were prepared for peer-review submission and are anonymized in accordance with double-blind review policies.  
Authorship information is intentionally withheld in the PDFs.  
They are shared here only as **writing samples** for PhD application evaluation, not for redistribution or citation.
